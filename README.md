The YouTube Trend Analyzer is an interactive data dashboard built using Streamlit that allows users to visualize and analyze trending YouTube video data in an intuitive and dynamic way. This project supports two modes of operation—one that uses a local CSV file containing historical data, and another that fetches real-time trending videos directly from YouTube using the YouTube Data API v3. Users can toggle between these data sources based on their needs, enabling flexibility for both offline and live analysis.

The tool provides deep insights into video performance trends by leveraging various filters and visualizations. Users can filter videos by publication date range and by category, making it easier to focus on specific content segments. Once filtered, the dashboard displays key performance indicators such as total number of videos, average views, and average duration. These KPIs are dynamically updated based on user selections, offering real-time analytical capabilities.

To help visualize engagement trends, the app features a time series line chart that shows total views over time, a bar chart that breaks down views by video category, and a scatter plot that explores the relationship between video duration and view count. In addition, the application generates a word cloud using video hashtags, offering a fun and visual way to understand common tags used across trending content. A detailed table also lists the top 10 trending videos based on views, including key metadata like title, category, duration, and publication date.

The backend handles important data cleaning and transformation tasks, such as parsing video durations from HH:MM:SS or MM:SS format into total minutes and ensuring all date fields are properly converted into datetime objects. In live mode, the app fetches the latest trending videos in India through the YouTube API, processes duration values from ISO 8601 format, and parses view counts and tags for further analysis.

This project is especially useful for content creators, marketers, researchers, and data enthusiasts who want to explore what’s trending on YouTube in a visual and informative way. It also serves as a great educational tool for learning about API integration, time series analysis, and dashboard development using Python. To run the project, users simply need to install the required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt), replace the placeholder with their own YouTube API key (which can be obtained from Google Cloud Console), and launch the app using streamlit run app.py.

By combining real-time data retrieval with rich, interactive visualizations, the YouTube Trend Analyzer provides a comprehensive look into the ever-evolving landscape of YouTube trends.
